# Music Club

Me and my friends have a weekly music club where we usually listen to a music album together via Spotify and rate it individually.
However, we ran into a problem: some songs don't have lyrics in the app, so I decided to make a simple website so we can see these lyrics dynamically.

## To-do

- playlist
- more lyrics + more pages
- lyrics obtained dynamically
- karaoke feature
